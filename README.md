# potions-and-stuff
## Collection of CLI games built with elixir
You can find specific instructions for the installation of each game,
a brief description, screenshots, rules and how to play written in the `README.md` of 
each games folder. Elixir 1.9.2 and Erlang 21 or higher are required. To install Elixir if you haven't already, [you can follow these instructions](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html)

Not ready to commit to a git clone? (pun intended :) ) You can view the source on
[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/obsessedyouth/potions-and-stuff)](https://repl.it/github/obsessedyouth/potions-and-stuff),
 and the run command `iex -S mix start`.
Know of a fun simple game I can make without having to build my own engine? I'd love to hear about it :)

*(Inspired by the capstone project of learn functional programming with elixir - Ulisses Almeida)*

2. Tic Tac Toe
