# DungeonCrawl

An exciting terminal game, survive a dungeon full of monsters and traps, earn treasure, exit safely!

## Installation
Assuming you have Elixir (1.9.2) installed. If not see the parent `README.md` for instructions.
`git clone` the parent repository, `cd` into `dungeon_crawl` and in your terminal enter `mix do deps.get, deps.compile` to install dependencies and then `iex -S mix start` to play in interactive scripting mode.

## Experimental branches? What's up with that?

The various branches existed as ways to test out various implementations of error handling strategies in elixir.
Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯ should I delete them? idk probably, but they aren't hurting anyone, so I'll keep 'em here for reference.
